     <div class = "bodyp">An evaluation is to determine a student’s progress and achievements. It is to help the educator determine if the student is being challenged to his/ her best potential.  An evaluation needs to be done by a licensed teacher, as set be the state of Colorado.  An evaluation meets the state requirements for all grades.  This means your student does not need to be formally tested. An evaluation, by law must be done in a Childs, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 11th grade years.
       An evaluation is a chance for the student to brag about what they have been learning. It is also an opportunity for parents to ask if they are on the right track, using the best curriculum for their student.  I am very low key and want the evaluation to be a good experience for both the student and the parent.  Please do not stress about what your student may have lacking in their studies, what you are about to discover is what amazing things your student does know! Children have a way of surprising their parents!
       An evaluation is to help you, not to bring what you’re doing at home under a microscope!  Believe me; you are doing a wonderful job teaching at home!  I will send you a hard copy or an email of the evaluation in about a week after I have completed the evaluation. You will receive a brief, typed, detailed evaluation on your student.  You will need to submit this evaluation to your umbrella school or keep in your homeschool file.  You do not have to send this until September, with your letter of intent.  The entire evaluation will take about 45 minutes to an hour.</div>
